        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> January 13, 2026</p>

        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>This website does not collect or transmit any personal information to servers. The only data stored locally in your browser is user preferences (e.g., time format and theme) using <code>localStorage</code>. Specifically, this site uses the keys <code>clock-format</code> and <code>clock-theme</code>.</p>

        <h3>Cookies & Tracking</h3>
        <p>There are no cookies, analytics, or third-party trackers included by default. If you add third-party scripts, they may introduce tracking — check those services' policies separately.</p>

        <h3>How We Use Data</h3>
        <p>Stored preferences are used only to improve the local user experience (remembering 12/24-hour mode and theme). No data is shared with or sent to third parties.</p>

        <h3>Your Choices</h3>
        <p>You can remove stored preferences by clearing site data or local storage in your browser. You may also change settings directly on the clock controls to overwrite stored values.</p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>Because this app runs entirely in your browser and does not transmit data, there is no user data transmitted over networks by default. Keep your browser up to date to maintain security.</p>

        <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this policy from time to time. If changes are significant, the effective date above will be revised.</p>

        <h3>Contact</h3>
        <p>To ask questions or request changes about this policy, replace this placeholder with your contact email or point-of-contact for the site owner.</p>
